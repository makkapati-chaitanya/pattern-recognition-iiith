# Pattern Recognition Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive implementation of various pattern recognition algorithms and techniques. The goal is to accurately identify and classify patterns within datasets, leveraging a combination of machine learning models, statistical methods, and image processing techniques.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes normalization, augmentation, and feature extraction to prepare raw data for model training.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Implementation of several pattern recognition algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- **Model Evaluation:** Tools to evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation and confusion matrix generation are included.
- **Visualization:** Visual representation of data patterns, model training, and evaluation results through various plotting tools.
- **Customizable Pipelines:** Modular codebase allowing easy modification and extension of pipelines for different datasets and pattern types.

## Installation

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pattern-recognition.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd pattern-recognition
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment and installing the dependencies, you can start experimenting with different pattern recognition models.

1. **Data Preparation:**

   Place your datasets in the `data/` directory. The project is designed to handle various formats, including CSV, images, and others.

2. **Training a Model:**

   Run the following command to train a specific model (e.g., SVM):

   ```bash
   python train_model.py --model svm --dataset data/your-dataset.csv
   ```

   You can specify different models and datasets by adjusting the command-line arguments.

3. **Evaluating the Model:**

   After training, evaluate the model performance:

   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py --model svm --dataset data/your-dataset.csv
   ```

   This will output metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. **Visualization:**

   Visualize the patterns and model performance:

   ```bash
   python visualize_results.py --model svm --dataset data/your-dataset.csv
   ```
